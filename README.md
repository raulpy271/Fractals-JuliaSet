# Fractals-JuliaSet
Algorithm in python that generates fractals based on the Julia Set.

The julia set is formed by points in the complex plane that small differences between them can cause a big change after iterating these points in a function. Learn more: [Julia Set - Wkipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set).

in this case, the interaction function is: f(z) = z² + c

## Julia Set,  c = (φ - 2) + (φ - 1)i

## Julia Set, c = 0.78 \* ( cos(x) +  i \* sin (x) ), x in [ 0, 2 \* pi ]

I made this video with a similar algorithm using javascript and the canvas element.
